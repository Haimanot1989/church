      "title": "They that Feared the Lord",
      "summary": "“Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.” (Malachi 3:16). Today, I feel like David with a burden for the young in particular, without neglecting the not so young. “Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD” (Psalm 34:11). Notice firstly that David desired to teach the fear of the Lord. This means that the fear of the Lord does not come on its own but must be taught. Who can teach the fear of the Lord, then? The answer is those who have been taught the fear of the Lord by others and continue to live in the fear of the Lord; individuals such as David. David in turn learned the fear of God through his own mighty experiences in the fields of Bethlehem and under holy men of God such as Samuel and Nathan. Malachi 3:16 states that “they that feared the Lord spake often one to another”. Fear of the Lord is developed through fellowship where the Lord Jesus Christ is the center and the subject of discussion. Why does the church gather together? Simply because by talking often about the Lord we will increase in the fear of the Lord. If you are a regular churchgoer, lift up your hands and thank the good Lord for this blessed habit. It is not a small matter to be called a God-fearer.",

      "summary": "“For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.” (Romans 1:20). A good study will always set the stage by defining the subject. The Encyclopedia Britannica has the following entry about atheism: “Atheism, in general, is the critique and denial of metaphysical beliefs in God or spiritual beings. As such, it is usually distinguished from theism, which affirms the reality of the divine and often seeks to demonstrate its existence. Atheism is also distinguished from agnosticism, which leaves open the question whether there is a god or not, professing to find the questions unanswered or unanswerable.“ In other words, atheism is also a belief: one which professes with certainty that God  does not exist. This is precisely where the problem of atheism lies – it is a belief with no evidence to support its claims. In other words, atheism is guilty of the same charge it levels against belief in God; it is also sustained by faith.",

      "summary": "“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” (John 1:14 ). The origin of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ is a matter of salvation. Jesus came into this world with a flesh which had its source in the Word of God – heavenly flesh. To believe that the Lord Jesus’ body was of an earthly, human, dust origin diminishes his glory and distorts the Lord’s work of salvation. In what follows, I will address a few objections raised against what is generally referred to as “divine flesh” or “heavenly flesh” doctrine.",

      "summary": "“In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;” (1Timothy 2:9). “Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:” (1 Peter 3:3-5). The Apostles Peter and Paul appear to say the same thing about the wearing of gold, silver and other jewelry. Simply stated, they prohibit the wearing of jewelry for God-fearing Christians. There are two main arguments they employ – God is more concerned with the “inner or hidden man” and, secondly, the choice not to wear jewelry demonstrates submission to God’s order.",

And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.” (Numbers 11:14-15,17). What spirit was upon Moses? The answer is the Spirit of God! Who would not want to have the Spirit of God that guided Moses? Moses was overwhelmed by the constant complaints and grumbling from the children of Israel who numbered about 2 million souls in total. God’s solution was to take the same Spirit that was upon Moses and share it with 70 elders. God wants more people to be filled with his Spirit. We cannot be happy with a few souls filled with the Holy Spirit in the church – the more souls filled the easier the path to heaven! We need our children to be filled with the Holy Spirit also. Today’s youth are being burdened with sins which earlier generations of youth have been shielded from. Like Moses they too feel the wear and tear of the stress and sin of the world invading their private spaces.",

      "summary": "“What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.” (1Cor 6:19-20). According to the Apostle Paul, our bodies are not our own; they belong to the Lord Jesus Christ. The price the Lord paid is his own blood. Since our bodies are borrowed from the Lord, we need to seek his counsel in all things regarding the Christian body. Our topic today is smoking. Fortunately, although it took several decades, even the secular world understands the dangers of smoking. Cigarette packets by law display the warning “Smoking kills”. Someone has said that smoking is slow suicide. Paul declared the body to be the temple of the Holy Ghost. “If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are” (I Cor 3:17). There is a tragic incident recorded in the Old Testament which underscores this truth. The sons of Aaron, the high priest, were drunk and offered “strange incense” or smoke which the Lord had not commanded. They were instantly killed for defiling the temple of God.(Lev 10:1). To smoke cigarettes, weed and other habit-forming intoxicants is no different than what Nadab and Abihu did.",

      "summary": "“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14). Why was the Law of Moses not intended for one nation, Israel, alone? The reason is because the Law did not provide salvation, it was the shadow of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ through whom salvation was extended. “But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster” (Galatians 3:23-25). Once the Sun rises, the shadow recedes and disappears. Similarly, salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ is universal; it is for the entire world. It was for this reason that the Lord himself spoke first on the Day of Pentecost in all the languages of the world. This was a declaration of intent: the Lord Jesus preached salvation in the tongues of the world to enunciate a new era – one in which there are no shadows anymore, but authentic salvation for all of humanity.",

We mistakenly think that Abraham was a Jew and the father of Israel alone. It comes as a surprise to some that Abraham was a Syrian. “And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous.”(Deuteronomy 26:5). Abraham was a Syrian who abandoned his country and ethnic roots because God offered him an infinitely grander vision – to become the father of many nations. In this respect, Abraham was unique – he was the first to do this. Had he chosen to be a Syrian, the best he could hope to achieve was to be a father of perhaps one Syrian tribe. Thankfully, he chose the vision of God – an international vision.",

      "summary": "“Hinduism has no single historical founder, no unified system of belief, no single doctrine of salvation and no centralized authority. In this sense it is different from other world religions.”(Warrier in Partridge 2005:134) The term Hinduism itself is a nineteenth century designation; however, archaeological excavations trace it back to the Indus Valley civilization (2500-1500 BC). The next 2000 years were dominated by the Aryans from whose writings, the Vedas – written in Sanskrit - much of Hinduism is based and evolved. Today there are over 900 million Hindus in the world making it the third largest religion in the world with the majority residing in India but due to migration patterns many have moved to the West. The origin of the caste-system, a highly controversial subject in India and much of the world, traces its origins to this period of the Vedas. The Vedas contained rituals prescribing various offerings to diverse gods. Those consecrated to perform them were the Brahmins or priests who assumed the highest position in the hierarchy. After them came the Kshatriyas (warriors or rulers), Vaishyas (merchants and commoners) and finally the Sudras (untouchables).",

The prophecy declared that the boy would become either a great King or a great religious figure. His father determined he would be a great King and gave strict orders for the boy to be shielded from experiencing anything that would lead him to seek answers in religion. The boy grew up living an artificial life – smiles, happiness and harmony met his gaze wherever he went within the confines of the palace and surrounding areas. One day, the story goes, the young prince, who was now twenty-five years old, asked his charioteer what lay beyond the walls that surrounded the palace. His charioteer tried to dissuade him but the young prince was determined and so they secretly rode out into the real world. He was shocked to see, for the first time in his life, an old person, a sick person, a corpse, and finally, someone attempting to follow a spiritual path. These events so overwhelmed his senses that he secretly decided to leave everything he had, including his wife and child. He was determined to find answers to the problem of suffering (Sanskrit: Dukkha). We will pick up the thread of Siddhartha’s spiritual quest later. Let us first grapple with the issues that led the young prince to abandon his privileged life.",

Furthermore, this salvation also implies, on the most rudimentary level, that we will live in heaven with God Almighty forever. This is where the similarity between the two religions ends. From time immemorial, humans have realized the wretched condition of this world and looked to the throne of God in heaven for deliverance and salvation. “Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?” Act 2:37",

The first and main difference between the Bible and Islam is the name of God. In the verses above, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob declares that his name is Jehovah.

Allah comes from the definite article al- “the” and ilāh “deity, god” combined to al-lāh meaning “the deity”, or “the God” in Arabic. Since the God of the Bible never used the name Allah, Bible believers conclude that this name describes and belongs to a foreign deity that Moses and the children of Israel never knew. Generally, knowing a person’s name is the first act in human relationships. God first mentioned the name of Moses twice at the burning bush (Exodus 3:4), and Moses asked God his name: “And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?” (Exodus 3:13).

In ancient times, harlots were also innkeepers engaged in the business of lodging and not prostitution necessarily. This information is important because the Israeli spies were not in the land for lust and physical pleasures, but on a holy mission. An inn (modern day motels/hotels) were public spaces where the spies could gather important information, hence a strategic location. However, these spies clearly were not professional or discrete enough because their cover was blown. “And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country” (Joshua 2:2).

Uzziah was the same king who did well in the eyes of God initially, but soon became lifted up in his heart and offered incense in the Temple which was the priests’ duty alone. God struck him with leprosy until he died. “And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land” (2Chron 26:21). Uzziah was king although he was a leper and Isaiah was a prophet although he was a man of unclean lips. This was a time in Israel when the king and prophet were paralyzed by their sins. Could it be that while we call ourselves Christians, pastors etc. in the church, we are actually paralyzed by our sins to be effective for the Lord Jesus Christ?

Daniel had been promoted. No one was more powerful than him in the Kingdom of Babylon except King Darius. Promotion and blessing brings envy also. The other Babylonian princes were not just happy to bring dishonor to Daniel, they wanted to destroy him completely. The reason is twofold: Daniel was appointed over them not just in position, but to ensure everyone paid their taxes and dispensed of their responsibilities. “And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage” (Daniel 6:2). Despite his exalted stature, and old age (he was over 80 years old), he would kneel down three times a day to pray to the God. Kneeling down is the posture of a beggar. It was begging God that always blessed and delivered Daniel from the capricious heathen Kings of Babylon. The scripture states that the “writing was signed”. In other words, praying to the God of Israel was now a state crime punishable by death. What can give a person the courage to accept the death sentence?

God is the source of every living soul. “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul” (Genesis 2:7). As such, anyone who wishes to count the souls of the people of God must acknowledge God’s ownership and Lordship over the souls of his people. Only God can give the order to number his people. In fact, an entire book, the fourth Book of Moses, is called the Book of Numbers because God ordered Moses to take a census of Israel twice in the desert. “Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls” (Numbers 1:2). Let us rejoice and take comfort in the fact that we are numbered among the people of God! Not only does the Lord Jesus know the precise number of his people, but the precise number of hairs on our heads. “But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows” (Luke 12:7).

When the Lord Jesus told us to pray, “Give us day by day our daily bread”, the Jews who heard him no doubt thought about the miracle of the manna in the wilderness. The Lord Jesus was not just talking about earthly food, but the Word of God which is more important than our physical sustenance. One reason the prophet Job is mentioned as one of three righteous men on the earth is because he esteemed the Word of God more than physical nourishment. “Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food” (Job 23:12). Let us meditate on the importance of the Word of God to motivate us to be like Job. Humans look below to the earth for food, but God thought the children of Israel to look heavenward every day for their physical food. “And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.” (Exodus 16:15) “For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.” (John 6:33-35) Let us say with those Jews, “Lord, evermore give us this bread”.",

The first reason is because God was manifest in flesh. This is astonishing because God did not take on the form of any other creature except ours. “For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham” (Hebrews 2:16). This is why humans must behold the God who was manifest in flesh. Shepherds in Bethlehem, wise men from the East, religious scribes, and even an evil King, such as Herod, all had one common interest in the greatest news flash in the history of the world: God was manifest in the flesh. Go and see him! John the Baptist shouted “Behold the Lamb of God!” We must all see him spiritually speaking and acknowledge that he is God manifest in the flesh. Why? Because he came in our form – the Almighty God who fills the universe, whom heaven and earth cannot contain, put on flesh and blood for our sakes. He conferred this honor upon us, hence we must behold him.

      "summary": "“And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.”(Judges 13:22-23). The marriage of Job and the marriage of Manoah were both founded on faith and righteousness. They loved God and were faithful in every way until both houses received supernatural visitation. It is a paradox that Christian marriages can be strong and stable until the supernatural intervenes. In the case of Job, it was Satan who intervened violently, while an angel of God visited the house of Manoah. In the case of Job’s house, his wife crumbled under the pressure. “Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die” (Job 2:9). The roles were reversed in Manoah’s household – the angel’s visitation brought a mortal fear upon him and he was certain the two of them would die, but his wife countered with 3 powerful arguments. She was certain that God sent the angel to bless them, which we will consider more carefully later. May I ask us all to reflect on the above for a moment! We look to heaven and mention heaven often in our walk with the Lord Jesus Christ, but what will a visitation from heaven reveal about our faith and love of God? The Bible is full of mixed responses when angels appeared to the people of God: Jacob recognized the angel at Peniel as an opportunity and an invitation to change his character forever while Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist, was struck with muteness because of his unbelief. What will heaven reveal about your faith whether you are married or single?",

God had planned from eternity to create a people who would be made in his image and have his moral character. “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them” (Genesis 1:27). However, the image this scripture speaks about is not one of dust. God was looking ahead into the time he would put on flesh and blood made of his own word and Spirit. “Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come” (Romans 5:14). Our focus today is not the nature of God’s church, but its destiny, so let us explore scriptures that broach this subject. Nevertheless, let every Christian know that his or her main assignment in this world, besides bringing people to salvation, is to testify to the prophetic events that point to the return of the Lord.

King Frederick the Great of Prussia (1712-1786) once asked his physician for proof of the existence of God. The physician is famously reported to have said, “Your Majesty, the continued existence of the Jews”. Against all odds, the Jewish nation has persevered despite persecution that at times reached genocidal proportions in various countries. Antisemitism is considered to be the world’s most successful hatred. It is unique in the annals of history because the Jews appear to be the only people whom sworn enemies in different eras had vowed to eliminate collectively as a people. Pharaoh, Haman, Hitler and Nasser of Egypt are some of the most prominent, but there were countless others with similar ambitions. Why has Satan so hated this people? The answer is simple, and provided by the Lord Jesus Christ himself. “Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews” (John 4:22). The Law, the prophets, Psalms and the New Testament emanated from Israel. When the fullness of time came (Galatians 4:4), God sent forth his Son from Israel to save the nations. The 12 apostles were Jews and Jesus will return to Israel from where he will rule the nations with a rod of iron (Revelation 12:5). Let us follow the spiritual history of this nation and its message for us who look for the return of Christ.",

But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs.”(John 19:32-33). God was manifested in flesh to die for our sins. God commissioned Roman soldiers to ensure that his body indeed was dead. Few were better trained to kill than Roman soldiers. Therefore, if anyone was competent in confirming an individual’s death, it was Roman soldiers. The Sabbath began at 6 p.m. on Friday and was only 3 hours away, so the Pharisees and their accomplices requested the death of the crucified, and their bodies buried before the Sabbath rest commenced. According to one report about ancient crucifixion methods: “The feet were nailed to the upright part of the crucifix, so that the knees were bent at around 45 degrees. To speed death, executioners would often break the legs of their victims to give no chance of using their thigh muscles as support. It was probably unnecessary, as their strength would not have lasted more than a few minutes even if they were unharmed.1“ John records that Jesus was already dead, so the soldiers did not break his legs. While the others clung to this world and earthly life, the Lord Jesus happily embraced death for our sakes.",

For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”(Philippians 2:12-13). James Strong defines “work out” in the following manner: κατεργάζομαι katergázomai, kat-er-gad'-zom-ahee; from G2596 and G2038; to work fully, i.e. accomplish; by implication, to finish, fashion:—cause, to (deed), perform, work (out). One can liken salvation to a package that contains instructions to navigate and negotiate the challenges in this world with the aim of making it to heaven. There is only one salvation accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ through his divine identity and atonement for our sins at Golgotha. “And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). The Lord Jesus accomplished his work of collective salvation when he died on the Cross, gave up the ghost, and said, “It is finished” (John 19:30). However, each one of us will find that the package of salvation leads us on unique paths that sometimes overlap, but often diverge. Hence, the words of the Apostle Paul, “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”. In fact, much of the Bible is a compilation of individuals who worked out their own salvation, and, according to Hebrews 11:2 “obtained a good report”. Let us consider some of these individuals and the way they worked out their own salvation and be inspired.",

Is there anything in the entire universe more powerful than the prayers of Jesus?Let us say together, “nothing”! Fear not! We have the power of the prayers of Jesus guiding us towards heaven.

This means that Noah had to explain and preach about the purpose of the ark for 120 years. The closer Noah’s generation approached the day of the flood, the higher the height of the ark.We can be sure that some were irritated by the sight of this massive and strange object that obscured their view,while others decided it was time to approach the architect and inquire about its purpose.In a similar vein, as our generation gets closer to the day of the Lord’s return, they must not fail to hear the Word of God – like the burgeoning ark, the word of God must confront their field of view. “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”(Matthew 24:14). May we share the word of God in such a way that, like Noah’s ark, it will demand a response–some will quarrel with us while others may politely come to gaze at us–but let us pray the word of God will demand a response, Amen!",

According to James Strong, this word is not limited to clothes alone, but includes anything made or prepared by humans, such as implements, vessels, weapons, bags, carriages, furniture, instruments,jewels, pots, sacks and even other wares/goods. Bible readers have traditionally linked this verse to clothes alone, but God had a much broader list in mind. It is difficult to deny that the further from God society deviates, the more comfortable they become with that which formerly “pertaineth” to the opposite sex. Remember that this “pertaineth” is about that which is made with hands. When God made Adam and Eve he made them distinctly male and female, and he does not look kindly upon anyone who seeks to confuse or obfuscate this distinction.",

They were six in total. Six represents the day before the Sabbath, a time when the people of God enter into their rest. I believe we are in the sixth day in this time. John does not name two of the apostles.

The Lord Jesus Christ is going to appear soon; do you hear his voice? I hear the voice of Jesus everywhere these days – in the wars and rumors of wars (Matt 24:6); in the pestilences (Matt 24:7 e.g. Covid-19); in the buying and selling (Luke 17:28); in knowledge being increased (Dan 12:4); in the selfishness of people (2Tim 3:2); in the ungodliness and lack of fear of God (2Tim 3:4,5) and in the world’s prejudice against the nation of Israel (Zech 12:3), to name a few. I trust all of you here today love the Lord and have determined to prepare yourselves for his coming. Jesus’ return will not be a source of terror for us, but the fulfillment of a lifetime of loving him and preparing for this very event. Hallelujah!",

Thoughts, attitudes and actions are evaluated through the overriding interpretive lens of tribalism. Tribalism can never lead to peace because it thrives and is sustained by mistrust of the intentions of other tribes, whether real or imagined. Satan understands the capacity of tribalism to engender evil throughout the generations so he stokes the flames of tribalism ever so often. For tribalists, the sins of other tribes against them is “sacred”. This is recorded in the collective memory and repeated dutifully to the next generation. Tribalism is a sin in the sight of God because it rebels against the command to love your neighbor as yourself; it refuses to see others as individuals made in the image of God – rather, it prefers to see entire communities as suspicious groups worthy of contempt.",

However, interestingly, we seem to detect a final sense of peace and contentment in her life when she finally stopped focusing on her own pain, and began to look up to heaven and praise the almighty God. “And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing” (Gen 29:35).

      "summary": "In Genesis 24:2-9, we read that Eleazer put his hand under the thigh of Abraham and swear to never bring a wife from among the Canaanites for Isaac. The thigh represents one’s seed and, by extension, one’s strength and future. Today, we are the Eleazers of Jesus – we must put our hands under his thigh and promise to bring children that are born again of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. We must bring royal seed that are worthy of the title that is on the thigh of the Lord Jesus Christ. May our blood test read, “Child of the king of kings and Lord of Lords",

      "summary": "The Lord Jesus Christ gave birth to us and is our Father. Many children can have one father, but one child cannot have many fathers. Right here we see the necessity of believing in one God alone, and not a Trinity. God supernaturally revealed to Isaiah the fatherhood of Jesus Christ 700 years prior to the word being made flesh in Israel: Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.",

      "summary": "From the beginning of time, there has been a battle for the attention of youth. God wants to open their eyes to spiritual matters, but the enemy is equally determined to overwhelm their eyes with earthly, material things. When the army of Syria came to capture Elisha in the city of Dothan, the young servant of Elisha was overwhelmed with what his eyes saw. \"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about\" (2 Kings 6:14). Thank God for the man of God! As long as there is an Elisha to pray for the eyes of the young to be spiritually opened, there is hope.",

      "summary": "One reason many believe the young man in this vignette(Mark 14:51-42) is Mark himself is the fact that only he included this story in his Gospel. This was his own, unique experience with the Lord, as we all have our unique experiences with the Lord Jesus. He wanted the world to know about his experience with the Lord. “And there followed him a certain young man” demonstrates this young man’s deep love for Jesus.",
