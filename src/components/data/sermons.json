      "summary": "What should a Christian do if the entire church forsakes the work of God and you find yourself alone? This was the unenviable situation that Eleazar the son of Dodo found himself in – he was deserted by all and left to confront the Philistines by himself. That is the time to firmly grip the sword that is in your hand and trust in God.",

      "summary": "In ancient times, kings set their seals only on that which was valuable – the king’s treasure. When King Jesus fills you with his Holy Spirit, it is proof that you are his treasure. We are redeemed not with corruptible things like silver and gold, but with the blood of God himself (Acts 20:28). Therefore, given the priceless cost of our souls, God seals his purchased possession with his own Holy Spirit. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is proof that God has chosen you and that you are royal property",

      "summary": "In Genesis 24:2-9, we read that Eleazer put his hand under the thigh of Abraham and swear to never bring a wife from among the Canaanites for Isaac. The thigh represents one’s seed and, by extension, one’s strength and future. Today, we are the Eleazers of Jesus – we must put our hands under his thigh and promise to bring children that are born again of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. We must bring royal seed that are worthy of the title that is on the thigh of the Lord Jesus Christ. May our blood test read, “Child of the king of kings and Lord of Lords",

      "summary": "The Lord Jesus Christ gave birth to us and is our Father. Many children can have one father, but one child cannot have many fathers. Right here we see the necessity of believing in one God alone, and not a Trinity. God supernaturally revealed to Isaiah the fatherhood of Jesus Christ 700 years prior to the word being made flesh in Israel: Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.",
