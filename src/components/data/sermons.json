      "title": "The Divided Garments of Jesus",
      "subtitle": "The Outer and Inner Garments of the Lord",
      "summary": "In this sermon, the focus is on the Roman soldiers dividing the garments of Jesus after His crucifixion. The preacher interprets this event symbolically, highlighting several key points.\n\nFirstly, the sermon emphasizes that Jesus had no earthly possessions except for the clothes He wore. The Roman soldiers represent the Gentiles, indicating that the Gospel was of great interest to them, unlike the Jews who rejected Jesus. The division of the garments into four parts represents the universality of the Gospel, signifying its message reaching all corners of the world.\n\nThe sermon also draws a connection to prophecies about Jesus' garments being divided among the soldiers and the Psalm that foretells this event. This highlights the idea that the Gospel is for those who understand its value and are willing to fight for it. It encourages believers to demonstrate zeal and determination, like Elisha, who desired to inherit Elijah's mantle. By inheriting Jesus' garments, it refers to receiving His anointing and favor to evangelize the world.\n\nMoreover, the sermon compares the disciplined and determined Roman soldiers to the soldiers of Jesus' Kingdom. It stresses the importance of believers being disciplined, trained, and determined to spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. The mention of Paul's handkerchiefs in Acts further emphasizes the power and impact that can come from items associated with anointed individuals.\n\nFinally, the sermon highlights the significance of the soldiers not tearing Jesus' seamless coat, representing the inner vesture. This garment symbolizes the need to enter the presence of Jesus, the High Priest, who cleanses and ministers to the needs of our souls. It emphasizes the Christian life as a continuous cycle between going out into the world to make disciples and returning to Jesus for spiritual nourishment.\n\nThe sermon concludes by urging believers, now in possession of Jesus' garments (anointing and priesthood), to march forward as Christian soldiers, conquering the world for Jesus. It encourages them to fulfill the Great Commission and utilize the power of Jesus to impact lives and bring others to Him.",

      "title": "Cleaving to Naomi",
      "summary": "The sermon is centered around the story of Ruth and Naomi from the book of Ruth. Naomi is a symbol of the Great Commission given by Jesus in Matthew 28:19-20, where believers are commanded to go and teach all nations. It is important to recognize the value of the Gospel and cleave to it, just as Ruth recognized the worth of Naomi and refused to let go. Ruth was committed to Naomi, so much so that she made a declaration to stay with her and follow her wherever she goes, even to the extent of adopting Naomi's people and God as her own. There is a parallel between Ruth's commitment and the disciples' willingness to follow Jesus when He called them. As believers, we need to allow the Gospel to lead and guide them, rather than determining its course ourselves. We must love all people of Jesus, regardless of divisions caused by race, culture, class, politics, or other issues in the world. The sermon also addresses the concept of dying to self and communal/national identity, stating that believers should be willing to give up personal plans and embrace the global mission of spreading the Gospel. It references biblical prophecies about global migration and mingling of different people in the last days, seeing it as a sign of the impending return of Jesus. The core message of the Gospel is presented briefly, stating that there is one God who manifested in a body, died on the cross for the forgiveness of sins, rose again, and poured out the Holy Spirit. The response to this understanding is repentance, baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit. The sermon concludes by highlighting Ruth's willingness to die to herself and her identity, which led to blessings for herself and future generations. It encourages listeners to cleave to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and become vessels through which all nations can be blessed.",

      "summary": "The sermon is based on the parable of Jotham from Judges 9:8-15, focusing on the significance of the olive tree as a symbol of humility, faithfulness, and service to God and humanity. The olive tree was chosen by the other trees to be their king but declined because it recognized its purpose in honoring God and serving others through its fatness (abundance) and the oil it produced. The sermon highlights the biblical references and symbolism associated with the olive tree, including its role in the Ark of Noah, the Temple in Israel, and the Garden of Gethsemane. The sermon encourages believers to emulate the olive tree's characteristics of knowing the source of their blessings, remaining faithful, and prioritizing service to God and others over worldly ambitions.",

      "title": "Seeking the Lord Like Mary Magdalene",
      "summary": "This sermon focuses on Mary Magdalene's encounter with Jesus after His resurrection. Mary's deep love and devotion to Jesus set her apart from the other disciples. She refused to leave the sepulcher and wept, stooping down to look inside. The sermon suggests that Mary's love for Jesus was profound because she had been forgiven of many sins and delivered from seven evil spirits.\n\nMary's intense seeking led her to see two angels in the tomb. However, instead of being distracted or amazed by the angels, she remained focused on her mission to find Jesus. Mary's love cast out fear, and she was unafraid of the angelic presence. The sermon emphasizes that only Jesus can bring true comfort and wipe away all tears.\n\nInitially, Mary did not recognize Jesus when He appeared before her. She mistook Him for the gardener until Jesus called her by name. Mary's unwavering love and devotion to Jesus allowed her to respond when He called her. The sermon encourages us to remember that Jesus calls each person by name and desires a close relationship with us.\n\nThe sermon concludes by highlighting the significance of Jesus' voice in drawing people closer to Him. Just as He called Peter and Lazarus, Jesus calls individuals today to draw near to Him. The sermon reminds us of the promise of a new name given by the Lord and encourages us to listen to the voice of the Spirit speaking to the churches.",

      "title": "If Jesus is the Only God, to Whom Did He Pray?",
      "summary": "This sermon addresses the question \"To whom did Jesus pray, if He is the only God?\". First, the sermon establishes that God is indivisibly and mathematically one, and Israel has always recognized and worshiped one God. In Mark 12:29, Jesus himself affirms that God is one.\n\nNext, the sermon affirms that Jesus is both the Holy Spirit and the Son. In John 14:18, Jesus promises to come back as the Holy Spirit to be with the apostles. 2 Corinthians 3:17 equates the Lord with the Spirit, and Galatians 4:6 calls the Holy Spirit the spirit of the Son. From these scriptures, it is clear that the Spirit received by believers is none other than the Spirit of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe sermon then delves into the need for intercession in prayer. In Romans 8:26-27, the apostle Paul writes how believers struggle to pray as they should and often fail to pray according to God's will. In God's mercy, He intercedes through believers. The sermon emphasizes that God requires sincere and fervent intercession for His will to be accomplished on Earth.\n\nThe sermon proceeds to illustrate the importance of intercession throughout the Bible, citing examples such as Abraham interceding for Sodom and Gomorrah and Ezra's prayerful response to Israel's sins. Only God Himself, who is Jesus, was found worthy to intercede effectively for humanity's salvation. This is supported by Isaiah 53:4-5, which speaks of Jesus bearing humanity's griefs and transgressions.\n\nRegarding Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, the sermon asserts that the cup, agony, and rebellious will being referenced were not Jesus' but humanity's. It emphasizes that Jesus, being sinless and incapable of sinning, couldn't be praying for Himself. The sermon refutes the idea that Jesus prayed to the Father or that His human nature prayed to His divine nature, stating that these explanations do not align with Scripture. Instead, it aligns with Romans 8:26, which states that the Spirit itself makes intercession.\n\nThe sermon concludes by urging Christians to reject confusing man-made doctrines and return to the doctrine of the Apostles. It asserts that the prayers of Jesus were addressed back to Himself, as He alone is God, and any belief otherwise leads to a plurality of Gods. The sermon affirms that God is one and declares that Jesus, as God manifested in the flesh, intercedes for believers. It encourages the listeners to allow Jesus to labor in prayer through them, bringing forth spiritual blessings.",

      "title": "Jesus our Refuge",
      "summary": "The sermon compares the biblical characters of Noah and Lot, emphasizing how Noah's devotion extended to his family and his primary focus was on building the ark, symbolizing his commitment to heavenly duties. In contrast, Lot is portrayed as someone primarily concerned with worldly gains. Noah, despite living in a corrupt and wicked era, is seen as a symbol of righteousness, highlighting that with God, it is possible to maintain holiness even in ungodly places.\n\nThe sermon also draws parallels between Noah's Ark and Jesus Christ. Just as there was only one ark, one door, and one window to save Noah's family from the flood, the preacher asserts that there is only one savior, Jesus, who can protect us from the coming destruction. The ark, despite facing harsh conditions, stayed intact because it was built according to God's word, symbolizing the indestructible nature of faith in Jesus.\n\nMoreover, the preacher highlights the unity among different creatures in the ark, illustrating that entering into Christ creates a transformative effect. The ark's multiple rooms and floors are used metaphorically to emphasize the need for tolerance and love among church members, with God having the power to change our characters. The sermon ultimately emphasizes the importance of seeking refuge in Jesus, who serves as our spiritual ark.",

      "title": "Good Friends Will Carry you to Jesus",
      "summary": "This sermon emphasizes the importance of good friends who guide us towards Jesus, as seen in Mark 2 when four friends take a paralytic man to Jesus for healing. Friends provide a sense of belonging and support, highlighting the scripture Proverbs 17:17, \"A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity\". Friendship in Christianity comes with responsibility. The sermon argues the paralytic man was blessed with four faithful friends who took him to Jesus despite his deteriorating state. It encourages Christians to invest in such friendships. Using the example of Philip, Andrew, and Nathanael, it illustrates how friends can lead each other to Jesus. The friends' determination in overcoming obstacles to take the paralytic man to Jesus is also celebrated. Sin, described as the enemy of good friendship, is believed to be the cause of the man's condition. The sermon asserts that friendship can heal through Jesus. Lastly, it prompts reflection on the health of our own friendships and encourages us to bring them to Jesus for healing.",

      "title": "David at Ziklag – The End of Fear",
      "summary": "This sermon explores the trials and tribulations of David, as described in the books of Samuel in the Bible, focusing on the theme of fear, faith, and personal redemption. It begins with David's despair and fear of Saul leading him to seek refuge with the Philistines, and the consequences of this decision. David, despite being a giant of faith, experiences a crisis of faith, driven by fear, and seeks refuge in the land of the Philistines. The sermon emphasizes that like David, believers too may experience such crisis and seek refuge in inappropriate places, although knowing it's not the right path. The sermon underscores the negative results of acting out of fear, as David is asked to battle against Israel and his granted city, Ziklag, is destroyed. The term 'Ziklag' is used as a metaphor for a turning point, symbolizing the end of fear. Despite adversity, David finds his faith again and leans on the Lord. The sermon encourages believers to trust in God during their 'Ziklag' moments and not to let fear lead them astray. This sermon advises believers to encourage themselves in the Lord Jesus Christ and not to compromise their faith out of fear.",

      "summary": "“And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Mat 16:18). The word church comes from the Greek ekklēsia and originally meant “a gathering of citizens called out from their homes into some public place, an assembly”, according to James Strong. The Church, in a Christian sense, refers to those whom the Lord calls out of the world and into his Kingdom through the agency of repentance, baptism in Jesus name and the infilling of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). It is important to underscore the fact, as stated in Matthew 16:18, that it is the Lord Jesus who is building the Church – he is the chief architect of this most glorious of kingdoms. God uses humans in various capacities in building his church, but make no mistake, it is the Lord who builds his Church, humans can only be co-laborers with him. “For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building” (I Cor 3:9). The Apostle Peter warned the elders of the Church, “Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock” (I Peter 5:3).",

      "title": "Doctrine of Holiness",
      "summary": "“Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.” (Leviticus 20:7) “Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.” (1Peter 1:16). The Hebrew word for “holy” is qāḏôš. James Strong defines this quality in this manner: “to consecrate, sanctify, prepare, dedicate, be hallowed, be holy, be sanctified, be separate”. The German theologian, Rudolf Otto (1869-1937), used the Latin term mysterium tremendum et fascinans to explain the holy encounter with God. He described this as an overwhelming power which is wholly different and other to this world. When confronted with God’s holiness, a human cowers with a sense of holy awe and terror. Jacob is a case in point. On the way to Haran fearing for his life, he encountered God at Bethel. “And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven” (Gen 28:17). Rudolf Otto went on to state in his book Das Heilige (1917), “It is like nothing human or cosmic; confronted with it, man senses his profound nothingness, feels that he is only a creature, or, in the words in which Abraham addressed the Lord, is ‘but dust and ashes’” (Genesis, 18, 27). To summarize thus far, God is the source of all holiness.",

      "summary": "“My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” (1John 2:1). What is the role of an advocate? The Greek word, paraklētos , means “one who pleads another's cause before a judge, a pleader, counsel for defense, legal assistant, an advocate”, according to James Strong. One needs an advocate because an advocate is trained in the language and custom of the law. We have all been summoned before the heavenly court of Christ’s judgement seat. “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad” (2 Cor 5:10). The Lord Jesus offers himself to us as our advocate. It would be downright foolish to reject this gracious offer. In his novel, The Trial, Franz Kafka (1883- 1924), wrote about a man who was accused of crimes he had no knowledge of and was summoned to a court were the charges were not read out to him. Be assured that everyone will have perfect knowledge of their sins when they appear before the righteous Judge of all the earth.",

      "summary": "“God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24). God is a Spirit, the Lord Jesus stated. This is how we should conceive of God in his original essence. The Spirit of God is everywhere – omnipresent. David famously declared, “Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there” (Psalm 139:7,8). Furthermore, the Spirit of God is also all-powerful, omnipotent. The Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters during the creation week (Gen 1:2). God’s Spirit also resurrected the long-dead army of Israel in the Valley of dry bones in the vision of Ezekiel. Not least, the Spirit of God inspired the prophets to prophesy. Ezekiel 11:5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.",

      "summary": "“There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.” (1 Corinthians 15:40). The word “celestial” is from the Greek epouranios which means “of heavenly origin or nature”. The Apostle Paul was building his argument to make a distinction between terrestrial or earthly (Greek epigeios) bodies and heavenly bodies. Finally, the argument climaxes with the revelation, “The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven” (I Corinthians 15:47). Adam’s body was of the earth, while the Lord Jesus’ body was from heaven. In fact, contrary to what many Christians believe, nowhere does the Lord claim to be of adamic descent. He plainly denied any relation to this world. “And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world” (John 8:23). Christ is really the holy Son of God. This fact is clearly established when we read, “the word became flesh”. No man can prove the biological relationship of Christ with Mary’s flesh and blood (Teklemariam, 1999, p. 123).1",

Through sin, the human body and soul/spirit were cursed. Any message of salvation hence must account for the salvation of the body and the spirit. Baptism is about the first part: the body. Baptism means to “submerge”, or “bury”. What is being submerged or buried? The answer is the human body inherited from Adam. “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive” (I Cor 15:22). Just as the children of Israel could not enter the Land of Canaan with their foreskins intact (Joshua 5:2-9), no one can enter the Kingdom of heaven with the body of Adam intact. “Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption” (I Cor 15:50). The covenant of circumcision foreshadows the New Testament command to be baptized in Jesus name. ",

When the Lord Jesus Christ was asked about the greatest commandment, the Bible records, “And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord” (Mark 12:29). It is clear from the response of the scribe that the Jews understood “one” to mean one single person – “he”. “And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he” (Mark 12:32). What the above means is that there is no room whatsoever for a so-called doctrine of the “Holy Trinity”. What is the doctrine of the Trinity? In its most basic form, it states that “(1) God is three persons (2) Each person is fully God (3) There is one God” (Grudem, 1994, p. 231). The Trinitarian scholar, Wayne Grudem, goes on to clarify what is meant by “God is three persons”. ",

And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment”(Judges 4:4-5). Today’s message is to encourage and edify sisters in their walk and ministries. Here was a woman called Deborah in the days of the Judges. All the Judges were men, except Deborah. Her name meant a “bee” and, indeed, she was busy as a bee for the Lord. Her husband’s name was Lapidoth, but she was the star of the story. We know many called Deborah in our days, but I haven’t come across a Lapidoth. She may have dwelt under a humble and obscure palm tree in mount Ephraim, but “the children of Israel came up to her for judgement” (Judges 4:5). She had many things going against her: she was a woman and she dwelt in an obscure place that was neither Ramah, where Samuel dwelt later nor Bethel the house of God, but God chose her to be a prophetess. In other words, the word of God was with her and all Israel came to her to know what the will of the Lord was and what course of action to take. This is tremendous power. I am sure many men were not happy about this. Before Israel demanded a King of God, the Lord chose whom he will judge Israel. Not only that, but Deborah also gained her fame during a famous battle which she initiated as the Lord moved her spirit.",

Just think about your feet for a moment. Consider trying to move your body without the aid of your feet. Neither our head, hands, knees or back can substitute for our feet when it comes to moving the entire body effectively. The head, hands, thighs etc. don’t seem to do much of use for the feet, so to speak, as the feet do in carrying all of the other members. Think now about a day or time when you walked around for several hours. Do you remember the ache you felt in your feet? There is a perfectly good reason shopping malls have cafés, sitting areas and benches spread around – they are meant for our aching feet. Let us take a moment to appreciate the job our feet do now and then! No wonder there are some who treat their feet to a well-deserved foot massage or foot bath. They work very hard for the rest of the body. Once we highlight the role feet play in our everyday, it becomes easier to appreciate the biblical culture of washing the feet of honored guests and travelers.",

We must expect the Devil to try to stir up many troubles and frustrations for the people of God when they embark on important spiritual missions. If the Temple and walls of Jerusalem would be rebuilt, people would repent, pray, and keep the commands of God. This was something the Devil was determined to stop although he knew the word of God cannot be stopped. Indeed, knowledge of the word of God and the futility of blocking its fulfillment has never deterred Satan from trying.",

A spirit of repentance and humility had seized them, and they knew that they had to go and hear the words of righteous John and be baptized in preparation for the coming of the Messiah. Only when people prepare to repent and make their way to the preacher (church) to make things right with God, will they hear a voice from heaven. What an amazing thing happened that day – humans heard a voice from heaven! This was the greatest pulpit in the history of preaching and the Father himself was the preacher. And this was the greatest sermon in the history of preaching – “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”. Once again, on the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter spoke but was cut off by the voice from heaven. Why would God cut off the words of his leading Apostle? What message was greater than that of the man with the keys of heaven? What did it say? It said: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him”. May God always cut us off when we stray away from this message!

      "title": "Go to Joseph!",
      "summary": "“And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.” (Gen 41:55). We are the Josephs of the Lord Jesus Christ in the world today! Few righteous people have been so abused and mistreated as Joseph. Consider it through the lens of two of Joseph’s garments: the blood-stained coat of many colors, and the garment that Potiphar’s wife showed to her husband. The first was to lie about his death and the second to lie about his sexual conduct. “Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all” (Psalm 34:19). Because Joseph had the favor of God and would deliver Egypt and the world from starvation, the Devil declared war on him. Let us learn from humble Joseph. He never carried a grudge or sought revenge throughout these terrible ordeals. Joseph points to us who are custodians and guardians of the knowledge of the salvation of God through Jesus Christ. Let us pray for the patience and forgiveness that characterized Joseph. One of these days, Pharaoh himself will command Egypt to “Got to Joseph!”",

      "title": "The Two Marks on Jesus’ Palms",
      "summary": "There are two cuttings or marks on the palms of the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first mark is the nail prints that we inflicted upon the Lord collectively on the Cross at Golgotha. “Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing” (John 20:27). All of us are invited to examine this cut or piercing we inflicted upon the Lord. “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). The Lord has refused to erase these wounds or scars from his hands because they bear witness of his Godhead, the expiation of our sins, his resurrection, his return, and his immeasurable love for humanity. This is the wound or the marking we inflicted upon him, but there is another mark on the palms of his hands that he himself inscribed or cut into. Isaiah 49:16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me. The Hebrew word ḥāqaq is translated as “to cut in or on, cut upon, engrave, inscribe” according to James Strong. Look at the palms of your hands. They contain lines that do not communicate anything intelligible, but the palms of the Lord Jesus’ hands proudly display your name and mine.",

      "summary": "“For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;” (2Peter 2:4). This sermon is about repentance. The Apostolic doctrine of salvation begins with repentance. “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost” (Acts 2:38). Fallen angels teach us a powerful lesson about repentance. Firstly, these mighty angels, who were immensely more superior than humans, were sitting in heavenly places. “And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven” (Luke 10:18). The higher the climb, the greater and more painful the fall! It is when we feel that we are on top of the world, so to speak, that the sin of pride comes and sneaks up on us. Heaven is the ultimate dream for all God’s creatures. Imagine meeting someone who was secure in heaven but was been kicked out – these are the demons that wander in the wilderness of the earth now. There was a time before Lucifer fell that he also walked in righteousness in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve, until he became corrupt and corrupted Adam and Eve too.",

      "summary": "“And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.” (Exodus 2:10).The water of the river Nile changed baby Moses’ destiny from that of a slave to a royal prince. Hallelujah! When Moses was put into the ark and lowered onto the waters of the river Nile, the hands that lowered the basked were those of a slave – Jochebed. The hands, however, which picked him out of the waters of the Nile were those of a royal princess – the daughter of Pharaoh (Heb 11:24). How did this incredible change in destiny happen? Between a life of slavery and the palace there was faith and water. “By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment” (Heb 11:23). When faith and water combine a miracle happens. I wish to talk to you today about the water that changes our destiny. There are some Jochebed here today: their children will be baptized in Jesus’ name. Like Jochebed you realized there is no future for your children no matter how much love you may shower upon them. “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned” (Mark 16:16). It is foolish to stay in the house of the damned; better to lower your child into the waters of baptism. Every good mother wants the best future for her child – then lower your child into the waters of baptism in Jesus’ name! The hands that will lift your child out of the waters on the other side in heaven are those of the Lord Jesus.",

      "summary": "“And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us” (Act 16:9). Let us remember that prior to this vision, the Apostle Paul appeared determined to travel to Asia but the Spirit of the Lord hindered him. “Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not” (Acts 16: 6,7). Why did Paul want to go to Asia and not Europe? Could it be that, as a devout Jew, he despised the polytheism and philosophical antagonism towards God that flourished in the West? Scripture does not tell us but let us read between the lines and draw some important spiritual lessons for our own exhortation today. Here was a great man of God, Paul, who was filled with the power of Jesus to save, heal and convert the entire world. No wonder the Lord carefully directed his every move “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).",

In the Book of I Chronicles 12, we read about the various tribes that joined ranks with David to fight against King Saul. All of them are mentioned in their thousands along with their bravery, except one tribe – Issachar. “And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment” (I Chron 12:32). They numbered just 200, but they had a unique gift which no other tribe seemed to have: they “had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do”. They may have been very few compared to the other tribes, but their gift of knowing the times and what to do compensated for their numbers. May God give us a tribe of Issachar which can discern the times we live in and what we ought to do for the glory of the Lord Jesus!",

Zelophehad had five daughters who it appears were unmarried virgins. Let us call them the five wise virgins. Zelophehad means “firstborn”. Certainly, the name of their father may have influenced his daughters. Never underestimate the power of a name to shape one’s destiny. I always advise saints to choose the names of their children with prayer and wisdom. The best reminder parents can give their children, when the parents are long dead, is the name/s you choose; it will still guide and influence them from beyond the grave. “And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying” (Numbers 27:2). These were clearly very brave virgins. Never before do we read of women seeking an official audience before Moses and leadership of Israel before the Tabernacle of the Lord with the entire congregation assembled. We can never hope to receive the great promises of God unless we are willing to risk our reputations and dream big dreams. “Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD” (Jeremiah 1:8). Those who see the face of God have no fear of the face of a Moses, Aaron, Eleazer etc.",

The number 24 represents several things. For one, it points to the 12 representatives of the tribes of Israel along with the 12 Apostles. Hence a completion of the entire assembly of God from the new and old testaments. “And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone” (Eph 2:20). In addition, the number 24 can also point to the Levitical order of service in the Temple structured by King David in I Chronicles 24:7-18. These priestly courses of service ensured there was service to the Lord 24/7. Incense, prayers, worship were offered to God on a continual basis. Hallelujah! The church has 24 elders who ensure continual service before the Lord Jesus in heaven. This is what the Apostle John found discovered and shared with us.",

      "summary": "“When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?” (Acts 1:6). This was the wrong question to ask the Lord Jesus? There is no kingdom to restore again to Israel because the kingdom belongs to Jesus. The correct question should have been: “Lord, will thou at this time restore the kingdom to yourself?” All prophecies declared that the Lord Jesus would gather Israel from the four corners of the earth, bring them back to the Holy Land and reign as King over them. “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this” (Isaiah 9:7). Please keep in mind that the current government of Israel is not a kingdom, but a parliamentary democracy. In other words, we need to look for a son, who is the everlasting Father, who will return and establish an eternal kingdom in Israel today. This can only be the Lord Jesus Christ. Be assured of one thing, saints of God, God is not a man that he should lie – he will not rest until he is crowned King of Israel.",

And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.” Genesis 45:1. We know the background to this incredible story. Joseph’s brothers had first tried to kill him and then settled on selling him to some Ishmaelite slave traders who took him to Egypt. Joseph, however, became the second most powerful ruler in Egypt because God was with him. Spiritually speaking, our sins are the brothers of Joseph. Every one of us is a Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Levi, Zebulon, etc. It was our sins that led our Lord to the Cross of Calvary. “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed” (Isaiah 53: 5). Our sins were the reason the Lord Jesus ended up on earth just as the sins of Joseph’s brothers was the reason he ended up in a foreign country, Egypt. Jesus said he was not of this world, and Joseph’s heart was never comfortable in Egypt. ",

Indeed, the Lord Jesus Christ is a miracle. A miracle can be defined as a welcome, unexpected event that cannot be explained by natural laws but a divine act. In his birth, the Lord Jesus was wonderful; angels, shepherds and wise men from the east came to marvel at his miraculous birth of a virgin. “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel” (Isaiah 7:14). As a 12-year-old, the doctors of the law marveled at the wisdom Jesus demonstrated in the seat of theological learning, the Temple in Jerusalem. The three-year ministry of the Lord was filled with non-stop gasps, shouts and screams of relief and joy on account of healings and deliverances wherever Jesus went. An eyewitness of the ministry of the Lord, John, wrote, “And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written everyone, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen” (John 21:25). His death and resurrection were also equally wonderful.",

All we need to do is open the pages of the Bible to enjoy this wisdom. So, what does Solomon say? He says there is a book that will lead you, keep you when you sleep, and talk with you when you awake. What an incredible book! Why don’t we all take out our Bibles, have a close look at it, and declare – “this is my best friend!” Is there a friend who can be so intimate as to keep us when we sleep? Yes, the word of God! “A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother” (Proverbs 18:24).",

We must now allow the curtain to fall on 2022 without first receiving the blessing from the Lord Jesus so that we can become a blessing to others in 2023. How precisely did God bless Abraham? First and foremost, Abraham knew the one God of heaven and earth. This is the greatest blessing of all! “And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord” (Mark 12:29). Kings bowed down to Abraham because of this blessing. The Canaanites were afraid to touch Abraham because his defense was his faith in the one God of heaven and earth. Often in the history of the nation of Israel, the children of Abraham compromised their faith in the one God, but it was as if the unshakeable faith of Abraham in the one God would pull them back to his God.",

      "summary": "“And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.” Genesis 32:1-2 At this point in Jacob’s life, he had suffered at the hands of two people for 20 years: Esau and Laban. It was because of Esau that he was a refugee in Haran separated from his family and the promise of God in the Land of Canaan. In Haran, he was tormented by his uncle Laban. This is perhaps why Jacob accepted his sufferings in Haran for so long – he was too afraid to return to Canaan because of Esau. When we do not have the strength to return to where we should be in the Lord, thank God that he himself intervenes and pushes us towards his will and promises. God told Jacob: “And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee” (Gen 31:3). When Jacob decided to return to the land of promise, the Bible says that he saw two companies of angels – for that is what Mahanaim means: two camps of angels. Hallelujah! One camp of angels went behind him to close the door to Laban and the past 20 years, and another camp of angels to face Esau and the future. I want to call this time of the year, as we head to 2023, Mahanaim – the Lord Jesus will send two camps of angels: one to close the door on the pain and sufferings of 2022 and another to lead us to confront 2023.

There is no greater blessing on earth than to be called the friend of God. Friendship is mutually beneficial – both parties derive great pleasure from talking together, sharing activities and just being in each other’s company. What a privilege it would have been to observe this relationship between Enoch and God! What intimacy, what love, what respect and every good blessing flowed to Enoch through this relationship with God! We should all desire a closer walk with Jesus! “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him” (Hebrews 11:6). Enoch believed passionately in this scripture. He demonstrated this for 365 years. Imagine that! ",

Leviticus 15 gives a detailed list of all that becomes unclean for the duration of the blood issue –beds,chairs, vessels, clothes etc. “And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.And everything that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean”(Leviticus 15:19,20). Perhaps this woman was terrified of the consequences of the Law of Moses, as I said previously. But she forgot that the Law of Moses had no power against the grace and love of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let me share a spiritual insight about the relationship between the issue of blood from women and the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.",

In the scripture passage above, the occasion was a festival of the new moon. This was a holy day, quite similar to the Sabbath, when all were expected to participate, be ceremoniallyclean, and offer up sacrifices.“And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot”(Num 28:11). For all these reasons, no one expected the seat of David to be empty. Anempty seat conveys a powerful message, especially when your name is David. Even the King, Saul, paid attention and was disturbed.May we serve the Lord Jesus so effectively that Kings and courtiers will take notice when our seats are empty. The tomb of Jesus was and is empty, and the entire worldpaid attention. It was the empty tomb that raised the question: who is Jesus and why did he die? The empty seat of David also raised many questions.

He was stationed in Judea somewhere between 26-36 AD. Pilate had spies and informants reporting to him and he must have received detailed reports about the character and miracles of the Lord. Pilate knew very well that the Lord’s mission was not political; in fact, he must have relished the Lord’s attacks on the Pharisees and Sadducees because Pilate could not stand these Jewish leaders himself. The historian Josephus wrote, among others, that Pilate entered Jerusalem with pagan images of the Roman Emperor Tiberius which enraged the Jewish leaders who demanded he remove these images. On another occasion, Pilate took money from the Temple to construct an aqueduct which also incensed the Jews against him. In other words, Pilate must have admired the courage of the Lord in standing up against his own enemies, alone. So, we can only imagine how unprepared Pilate was when he suddenly saw the Lord brought before him accused of blasphemy and the Jews demanding his crucifixion. Pilate had the distinction of being the only person before whom the Lord was brought on trial – the only man who could pass the deaths sentence on Jesus. Since Pilate, however, Jesus has appeared before the judgment seats of countless people because we must all pass a judgment on his identity. Pilate asked the wrong question to the Jews: What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?

      "summary": "“And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.” Matthew 9:9 Years later, the apostle Matthew records the time he met the Lord Jesus. He was a tax collector, a publican. Not only Jews, but every nation under the yoke of Rome, hated tax collectors.  James Strong defines a publican in this manner: “a tax gatherer, collector of taxes or tolls, one employed by a publican or farmer general in the collection of taxes. The tax collectors were as a class, detested not only by the Jews, but by other nations also, both on account of their employment and of the harshness, greed, and deception, with which they did their job”. Matthew means “gift of Jehovah”, but clearly, he was more like the “curse of Jehovah” for everyone who met him. He was obviously used to receiving hate, threats and abuse from Jews which he normally dished out to them. The Devil wants some people to expect everyone to hate them so they can continue in their own hatred of others. No one ever invited Matthew to their homes or affairs. To choose a job where you work for the arch enemy of your people and extort taxes from the poor, is to permanently separate oneself from the nation of Israel. But one day, one merciful day, he saw a man coming towards him. This man did not have any hatred toward Matthew, only profound love. His name was Jesus.",

If God is our address, we have the biggest house in the universe indeed. While Solomon’s Temple was a wonder to behold, Solomon acknowledged that no building can ever dream of serving as God’s house. “But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?” (2Chron 2:6). The good news is this: while nothing humans can build will ever accommodate God, God invites one and all to dwell in him. Hallelujah! “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me” (John 15:4). Moses, who wrote Psalm 91, did not seem to have any secure, permanent dwelling place made of mud and bricks once he killed the Egyptian man and fled to Midian. For forty years he wandered in the desert with the people of God. He became a nomad – the word comes from Latin “nomas” and means a wandering shepherd. When one gives up a secure, permanent dwelling place for the sake of the people of God, then God himself becomes your address. No wonder Moses declares confidently that no evil, nor plague shall come near those who make the most high their habitation. God was Moses’ address!",

This would be an egregious error. God does not accept that any of his blessings, however small, are chucked away or neglected. This is the very reason the Lord Jesus commanded the apostles to gather the fragments of bread after he miraculously fed the 5000. “When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore, they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten” (John 6:12, 13).

And he said unto them, It is enough” (Luke 22:38). Galileans were known to be straightforward people who did not shy away from a confrontation, and they interpreted the words of the Lord literally. Once they came to Jerusalem, the Lord was arrested. They were 13 including the Lord. How can two swords between 13 men fight against the well-armed soldiers of the high priest who were also backed up by the Roman soldiers? Yet because Peter’s love for the Lord was so great, he ignored the odds against them and struck the high priest, Malchus’ head with his sword. Fortunately, Peter missed the head and cut off an ear.",

The human body has never been healthier and more robust than at the moment God breathed life unto Adam, looked at him and declared that it was very good. This was a body designed to live forever on earth. Just consider the earth from which our bodies have been made. The Spirit of God replenishes the earth so that it produces food in abundance. God heals nature every day; we can witness the principles of healing and reparation in nature. The God who heals and restores the soil of the earth is able to heal and restore our natural bodies which were created from the earth.

One way of interpreting the words of the Lord is to think of the carnal flesh as having two eyes, while the spiritual person sees with just one eye – the eye that see Jesus. Consider how many people saw the Lord Jesus during his ministry and yet despised and reviled him! The Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, Herod and Pilate, all saw the Lord Jesus, but did not benefit from what their eyes beheld. On the other hand, thank God for people like Anna and Simeon! These were prophets who already saw the Lord Jesus through the eyes of the Holy Spirit. “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:  For mine eyes have seen thy salvation” (Luke 2:29,30).",

This teaching further misuses the apostle Paul’s teaching and states that just as Sarah is the spiritual mother of Israel, the local church where one receives salvation becomes a “Sarah” with legitimate claims on the loyalty of the members. Finally, they misappropriate the type and shadow teaching in Genesis 2:21 to justify their “ownership” of their church members. For the sake of convenience, let us call this doctrine the “doctrine of national ownership of Apostolic souls”. None of the above stands up to scriptural scrutiny, and we need to address each one by one.

Women have suffered much throughout history – abuse, violence and prejudice for just being women. Now, however, in the New Testament, women were the first to hear the Gospel and believe. The prophecy of the seed of the woman was now being fulfilled in Nazareth. Let us remember that the Devil knew that God had anyhow planned to deliver humanity from sin through his own flesh and blood. He was aware that humans made of the dust cannot be the image of God. The real image of God is Jesus Christ, and the Devil knew he had to be born of a woman, hence the reason he targeted Eve.",

They were dead and dry, but not buried. “And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border” (Jer 31:17). The believer does not go to the funeral of a soul – we go in the hope of resurrecting the soul in Jesus’ name! In his entire ministry, the Lord Jesus never attended funerals so the “souls could rest in peace”; he came to the tomb of Lazarus to raise him back from the dead. Every death that Jesus encountered, the soul was ordered back to the land of the living. No wonder he declared, “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live” (John 11:25).

As I speak (or you read), perhaps the pain of some childhood incident may sadly be reignited. Firstly, be assured it is not your fault, just as it was not Mephibosheth’s fault that he was dropped by his nurse. Simultaneously, we cannot blame the nurse; she saved the life of Mephibosheth.

Amen! Perhaps we should begin with praise like Judah did in Jehovah’s sight before the sermon (sing “As David did in Jehovah’s sight …). Let us first understand what happened in the original valley of Berachah and do the same here today. Jehoshaphat was a godly king in Judah. He served God sincerely and demonstrated his love in many ways. However, he had one weakness – he was a close friend of Ahab, the wicked king of Israel. In our text today, Jehoshaphat received the frightening news that his enemies had secretly assembled outside of Jerusalem and were ready to capture the city and Judah. “It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle” (2Chronicles 20:1).

This was before the Lord gave the call to Abraham to go to the Land of Canaan. It is important that I rectify this misunderstanding. I have heard many Christians state that Abram heard the call of God in Ur of the Chaldees, but this is not true. Abram the call of God to go to the Land of Canaan in the Haran, Syria, where his father, Terah, had settled. It was actually Terha his father who left Ur for the Land of Canaan. “So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran” (Genesis 12:4).

Let us begin with the first one. “And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons” (Genesis 3:7). We do not know the species of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but we know that the first humans sought to hide their shame with the leaves of the fig tree. Jews have a long tradition of praying under fig trees, and Nathaniel most probably was praying under a fig tree when Philip approached him. We are not told what he was praying for but Jesus said, “Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee” (John 1:48). Perhaps Nathanael prayed for the salvation of Israel and the world. It was no coincidence the Lord directed Philip to the fig tree. Saints of God in Europe, we must spend more time under the fig tree praying for the salvation of Europe. Jesus will see us – he will be moved by our tears and send a Philip to us.",

In doing so we will send the Lord Jesus the message that we respect his holiness and are ready to submit to his will. The desert was hot, and one cannot walk around on bare feet. In addition, the desert floor was creeping with dangerous creatures such as snakes and scorpions. Furthermore, Moses would be unable to tend to the sheep of his father-in-law, Jethro, without shoes. One becomes very vulnerable without shoes in such an inhospitable environment. Nevertheless, God demands the removal of shoes. In repentance we show God that we have no other defense other than God.

The Ark of the Covenant replaced faith in the God of Israel in the early days of Eli the High Priest. The Ark was worshipped rather than God. Keepers of the Ark are those who lose sight of the truth of God and focus on the ceremonial, traditional and ritualistic things associated with religion. With time, the children of Israel became keepers of the Ark but not Keepers of the Truth. In other words, they associated seeing the Ark of the Covenant with salvation and protection of God rather than the God who is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent; the God who cannot be reduced to a box made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. God hates this because it is no different from creating a new false religion.",

And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?” (Luke 10:27-29). “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.” (John 13:34). “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.” (John 13:34) There are two categories of people Jesus commanded us to love unconditionally after God: our neighbors and the people of God. Sometimes the commandments that appear to be the easiest to understand turn out to be the hardest to implement. Let us go back to the basics of God: “And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him” (I John 4:16). The question is: have we known and believed the love that God hath to us? In other words, we cannot love others if we have not experienced the love of the Lord Jesus Christ. What was the overpowering force that drew the apostles to leave everything and follow Jesus? What is the power that still attracts millions worldwide to follow Jesus? The answer is his love.",

Today, I feel like David with a burden for the young in particular, without neglecting the not so young. “Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD” (Psalm 34:11). Notice firstly that David desired to teach the fear of the Lord. This means that the fear of the Lord does not come on its own but must be taught. Who can teach the fear of the Lord, then? The answer is those who have been taught the fear of the Lord by others and continue to live in the fear of the Lord; individuals such as David. David in turn learned the fear of God through his own mighty experiences in the fields of Bethlehem and under holy men of God such as Samuel and Nathan. Malachi 3:16 states that “they that feared the Lord spake often one to another”. Fear of the Lord is developed through fellowship where the Lord Jesus Christ is the center and the subject of discussion. Why does the church gather together? Simply because by talking often about the Lord we will increase in the fear of the Lord. If you are a regular churchgoer, lift up your hands and thank the good Lord for this blessed habit. It is not a small matter to be called a God-fearer.",

A good study will always set the stage by defining the subject. The Encyclopedia Britannica has the following entry about atheism: “Atheism, in general, is the critique and denial of metaphysical beliefs in God or spiritual beings. As such, it is usually distinguished from theism, which affirms the reality of the divine and often seeks to demonstrate its existence. Atheism is also distinguished from agnosticism, which leaves open the question whether there is a god or not, professing to find the questions unanswered or unanswerable.“ In other words, atheism is also a belief: one which professes with certainty that God  does not exist. This is precisely where the problem of atheism lies – it is a belief with no evidence to support its claims. In other words, atheism is guilty of the same charge it levels against belief in God; it is also sustained by faith.",

The origin of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ is a matter of salvation. Jesus came into this world with a flesh which had its source in the Word of God – heavenly flesh. To believe that the Lord Jesus’ body was of an earthly, human, dust origin diminishes his glory and distorts the Lord’s work of salvation.

The Apostles Peter and Paul appear to say the same thing about the wearing of gold, silver and other jewelry. Simply stated, they prohibit the wearing of jewelry for God-fearing Christians. There are two main arguments they employ – God is more concerned with the “inner or hidden man” and, secondly, the choice not to wear jewelry demonstrates submission to God’s order.",

What spirit was upon Moses? The answer is the Spirit of God! Who would not want to have the Spirit of God that guided Moses? Moses was overwhelmed by the constant complaints and grumbling from the children of Israel who numbered about 2 million souls in total. God’s solution was to take the same Spirit that was upon Moses and share it with 70 elders. God wants more people to be filled with his Spirit. We cannot be happy with a few souls filled with the Holy Spirit in the church – the more souls filled the easier the path to heaven! We need our children to be filled with the Holy Spirit also. Today’s youth are being burdened with sins which earlier generations of youth have been shielded from.

For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.” (1Cor 6:19-20). According to the Apostle Paul, our bodies are not our own; they belong to the Lord Jesus Christ. The price the Lord paid is his own blood. Since our bodies are borrowed from the Lord, we need to seek his counsel in all things regarding the Christian body. Our topic today is smoking. Fortunately, although it took several decades, even the secular world understands the dangers of smoking. Cigarette packets by law display the warning “Smoking kills”. Someone has said that smoking is slow suicide. Paul declared the body to be the temple of the Holy Ghost. “If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are” (I Cor 3:17). There is a tragic incident recorded in the Old Testament which underscores this truth. The sons of Aaron, the high priest, were drunk and offered “strange incense” or smoke which the Lord had not commanded. They were instantly killed for defiling the temple of God.(Lev 10:1). To smoke cigarettes, weed and other habit-forming intoxicants is no different than what Nadab and Abihu did.",

      "summary": "“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14). Why was the Law of Moses not intended for one nation, Israel, alone? The reason is because the Law did not provide salvation, it was the shadow of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ through whom salvation was extended. “But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster” (Galatians 3:23-25). Once the Sun rises, the shadow recedes and disappears. Similarly, salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ is universal; it is for the entire world. It was for this reason that the Lord himself spoke first on the Day of Pentecost in all the languages of the world. This was a declaration of intent: the Lord Jesus preached salvation in the tongues of the world to enunciate a new era – one in which there are no shadows anymore, but authentic salvation for all of humanity.",

We mistakenly think that Abraham was a Jew and the father of Israel alone.

Abraham was a Syrian who abandoned his country and ethnic roots because God offered him an infinitely grander vision – to become the father of many nations. In this respect, Abraham was unique – he was the first to do this. Had he chosen to be a Syrian, the best he could hope to achieve was to be a father of perhaps one Syrian tribe. Thankfully, he chose the vision of God – an international vision.",

The next 2000 years were dominated by the Aryans from whose writings, the Vedas – written in Sanskrit - much of Hinduism is based and evolved. Today there are over 900 million Hindus in the world making it the third largest religion in the world with the majority residing in India but due to migration patterns many have moved to the West. The origin of the caste-system, a highly controversial subject in India and much of the world, traces its origins to this period of the Vedas. The Vedas contained rituals prescribing various offerings to diverse gods. Those consecrated to perform them were the Brahmins or priests who assumed the highest position in the hierarchy. After them came the Kshatriyas (warriors or rulers), Vaishyas (merchants and commoners) and finally the Sudras (untouchables).",

The prophecy declared that the boy would become either a great King or a great religious figure. His father determined he would be a great King and gave strict orders for the boy to be shielded from experiencing anything that would lead him to seek answers in religion. The boy grew up living an artificial life – smiles, happiness and harmony met his gaze wherever he went within the confines of the palace and surrounding areas. One day, the story goes, the young prince, who was now twenty-five years old, asked his charioteer what lay beyond the walls that surrounded the palace. His charioteer tried to dissuade him but the young prince was determined and so they secretly rode out into the real world. He was shocked to see, for the first time in his life, an old person, a sick person, a corpse, and finally, someone attempting to follow a spiritual path. These events so overwhelmed his senses that he secretly decided to leave everything he had, including his wife and child. He was determined to find answers to the problem of suffering (Sanskrit: Dukkha). We will pick up the thread of Siddhartha’s spiritual quest later.

Uzziah was the same king who did well in the eyes of God initially, but soon became lifted up in his heart and offered incense in the Temple which was the priests’ duty alone. God struck him with leprosy until he died. “And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land” (2Chron 26:21). Uzziah was king although he was a leper and Isaiah was a prophet although he was a man of unclean lips. This was a time in Israel when the king and prophet were paralyzed by their sins.

Despite his exalted stature, and old age (he was over 80 years old), he would kneel down three times a day to pray to the God. Kneeling down is the posture of a beggar.

God is the source of every living soul. “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul” (Genesis 2:7). As such, anyone who wishes to count the souls of the people of God must acknowledge God’s ownership and Lordship over the souls of his people. Only God can give the order to number his people. In fact, an entire book, the fourth Book of Moses, is called the Book of Numbers because God ordered Moses to take a census of Israel twice in the desert. “Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls” (Numbers 1:2). Let us rejoice and take comfort in the fact that we are numbered among the people of God!

When the Lord Jesus told us to pray, “Give us day by day our daily bread”, the Jews who heard him no doubt thought about the miracle of the manna in the wilderness. The Lord Jesus was not just talking about earthly food, but the Word of God which is more important than our physical sustenance. One reason the prophet Job is mentioned as one of three righteous men on the earth is because he esteemed the Word of God more than physical nourishment. “Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food” (Job 23:12). Let us meditate on the importance of the Word of God to motivate us to be like Job. Humans look below to the earth for food, but God thought the children of Israel to look heavenward every day for their physical food. “And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.” (Exodus 16:15) “For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.” (John 6:33-35) Let us say with those Jews, “Lord, evermore give us this bread”.",

      "title": "Six Reasons why the Mystery of Godliness is Great",
      "summary": "“And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.”(1Timothy 3:16). The first reason is because God was manifest in flesh. This is astonishing because God did not take on the form of any other creature except ours. “For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham” (Hebrews 2:16). This is why humans must behold the God who was manifest in flesh. Shepherds in Bethlehem, wise men from the East, religious scribes, and even an evil King, such as Herod, all had one common interest in the greatest news flash in the history of the world: God was manifest in the flesh. Go and see him! John the Baptist shouted “Behold the Lamb of God!” We must all see him spiritually speaking and acknowledge that he is God manifest in the flesh. Why? Because he came in our form – the Almighty God who fills the universe, whom heaven and earth cannot contain, put on flesh and blood for our sakes. He conferred this honor upon us, hence we must behold him. In other words, because God was manifest in flesh, everyone who is in the form of flesh, must leave everything – as the shepherds and wise men were commanded – and run to Bethlehem to behold him and give him gifts to thank him and bless him because he came to save us.",

      "summary": "“And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.”(Judges 13:22-23). The marriage of Job and the marriage of Manoah were both founded on faith and righteousness. They loved God and were faithful in every way until both houses received supernatural visitation. It is a paradox that Christian marriages can be strong and stable until the supernatural intervenes. In the case of Job, it was Satan who intervened violently, while an angel of God visited the house of Manoah. In the case of Job’s house, his wife crumbled under the pressure. “Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die” (Job 2:9). The roles were reversed in Manoah’s household – the angel’s visitation brought a mortal fear upon him and he was certain the two of them would die, but his wife countered with 3 powerful arguments. She was certain that God sent the angel to bless them, which we will consider more carefully later. May I ask us all to reflect on the above for a moment! We look to heaven and mention heaven often in our walk with the Lord Jesus Christ, but what will a visitation from heaven reveal about our faith and love of God? The Bible is full of mixed responses when angels appeared to the people of God: Jacob recognized the angel at Peniel as an opportunity and an invitation to change his character forever while Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist, was struck with muteness because of his unbelief. What will heaven reveal about your faith whether you are married or single?",

God had planned from eternity to create a people who would be made in his image and have his moral character. “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them” (Genesis 1:27). However, the image this scripture speaks about is not one of dust. God was looking ahead into the time he would put on flesh and blood made of his own word and Spirit. “Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come” (Romans 5:14). Our focus today is not the nature of God’s church, but its destiny, so let us explore scriptures that broach this subject. Nevertheless, let every Christian know that his or her main assignment in this world, besides bringing people to salvation, is to testify to the prophetic events that point to the return of the Lord.

King Frederick the Great of Prussia (1712-1786) once asked his physician for proof of the existence of God. The physician is famously reported to have said, “Your Majesty, the continued existence of the Jews”. Against all odds, the Jewish nation has persevered despite persecution that at times reached genocidal proportions in various countries. Antisemitism is considered to be the world’s most successful hatred. It is unique in the annals of history because the Jews appear to be the only people whom sworn enemies in different eras had vowed to eliminate collectively as a people. Pharaoh, Haman, Hitler and Nasser of Egypt are some of the most prominent, but there were countless others with similar ambitions. Why has Satan so hated this people? The answer is simple, and provided by the Lord Jesus Christ himself. “Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews” (John 4:22). The Law, the prophets, Psalms and the New Testament emanated from Israel. When the fullness of time came (Galatians 4:4), God sent forth his Son from Israel to save the nations. The 12 apostles were Jews and Jesus will return to Israel from where he will rule the nations with a rod of iron (Revelation 12:5). Let us follow the spiritual history of this nation and its message for us who look for the return of Christ.",

But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs.”(John 19:32-33). God was manifested in flesh to die for our sins. God commissioned Roman soldiers to ensure that his body indeed was dead. Few were better trained to kill than Roman soldiers. Therefore, if anyone was competent in confirming an individual’s death, it was Roman soldiers. The Sabbath began at 6 p.m. on Friday and was only 3 hours away, so the Pharisees and their accomplices requested the death of the crucified, and their bodies buried before the Sabbath rest commenced. According to one report about ancient crucifixion methods: “The feet were nailed to the upright part of the crucifix, so that the knees were bent at around 45 degrees. To speed death, executioners would often break the legs of their victims to give no chance of using their thigh muscles as support. It was probably unnecessary, as their strength would not have lasted more than a few minutes even if they were unharmed.1“ John records that Jesus was already dead, so the soldiers did not break his legs. While the others clung to this world and earthly life, the Lord Jesus happily embraced death for our sakes.",

      "summary": "“Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”(Philippians 2:12-13). James Strong defines “work out” in the following manner: κατεργάζομαι katergázomai, kat-er-gad'-zom-ahee; from G2596 and G2038; to work fully, i.e. accomplish; by implication, to finish, fashion:—cause, to (deed), perform, work (out). One can liken salvation to a package that contains instructions to navigate and negotiate the challenges in this world with the aim of making it to heaven. There is only one salvation accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ through his divine identity and atonement for our sins at Golgotha. “And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). The Lord Jesus accomplished his work of collective salvation when he died on the Cross, gave up the ghost, and said, “It is finished” (John 19:30). However, each one of us will find that the package of salvation leads us on unique paths that sometimes overlap, but often diverge. Hence, the words of the Apostle Paul, “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”. In fact, much of the Bible is a compilation of individuals who worked out their own salvation, and, according to Hebrews 11:2 “obtained a good report”. Let us consider some of these individuals and the way they worked out their own salvation and be inspired.",

Is there anything in the entire universe more powerful than the prayers of Jesus?Let us say together, “nothing”! Fear not! We have the power of the prayers of Jesus guiding us towards heaven.

This means that Noah had to explain and preach about the purpose of the ark for 120 years. The closer Noah’s generation approached the day of the flood, the higher the height of the ark.We can be sure that some were irritated by the sight of this massive and strange object that obscured their view,while others decided it was time to approach the architect and inquire about its purpose.In a similar vein, as our generation gets closer to the day of the Lord’s return, they must not fail to hear the Word of God – like the burgeoning ark, the word of God must confront their field of view. “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”(Matthew 24:14). May we share the word of God in such a way that, like Noah’s ark, it will demand a response–some will quarrel with us while others may politely come to gaze at us–but let us pray the word of God will demand a response, Amen!",

According to James Strong, this word is not limited to clothes alone, but includes anything made or prepared by humans, such as implements, vessels, weapons, bags, carriages, furniture, instruments,jewels, pots, sacks and even other wares/goods. Bible readers have traditionally linked this verse to clothes alone, but God had a much broader list in mind. It is difficult to deny that the further from God society deviates, the more comfortable they become with that which formerly “pertaineth” to the opposite sex. Remember that this “pertaineth” is about that which is made with hands. When God made Adam and Eve he made them distinctly male and female, and he does not look kindly upon anyone who seeks to confuse or obfuscate this distinction.",

The children of Israel never got the opportunity to assemble themselves together in the name of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in Egypt for 400 years. Imagine being in a lockdown for 400 years and the name of the virus is Pharaoh! Thank God we have digital communication applications such as Zoom which gave us a semblance of church – at least we heard the word of God, prayed and worshipped. Sadly, there was no preaching, exhortation, singing and worship to God for 400 years in Egypt. Pharaoh made sure they never got time to assemble in the name of Jehovah. On the contrary, Pharaoh managed the lives of the Hebrews slaves in such a way that they their energy and waking hours were consumed in building idols and monuments for Pharaoh, such as the city of Ramses (Exodus 1:11). Apostolics must understand the enemy will do everything in his power to stop us from assembling together in the name of Jesus.",

Tithing is a covenant between God and the Christian who is born again, according to the command in Acts 2:38. The covenant of tithing was only for the children of Abraham, not the unsaved. “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). Tithing is a test: God tests the Christian’s ability to trust him with his or her material wealth.

For tribalists, the sins of other tribes against them is “sacred”. This is recorded in the collective memory and repeated dutifully to the next generation. Tribalism is a sin in the sight of God because it rebels against the command to love your neighbor as yourself; it refuses to see others as individuals made in the image of God – rather, it prefers to see entire communities as suspicious groups worthy of contempt.",

However, interestingly, we seem to detect a final sense of peace and contentment in her life when she finally stopped focusing on her own pain, and began to look up to heaven and praise the almighty God. “And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing” (Gen 29:35).

Just as salmon find their way back from the vast ocean to their place of birth in a fresh stream, sinners will find they cannot resist the Spirit and love of Jesus Christ. Brothers and sisters, take courage from the prophecy of Joel! Today we strive with the lost, but one of these days, they will fly like doves back to where they belong.",

      "summary": "What should a Christian do if the entire church forsakes the work of God and you find yourself alone? This was the unenviable situation that Eleazar the son of Dodo found himself in – he was deserted by all and left to confront the Philistines by himself. That is the time to firmly grip the sword that is in your hand and trust in God.",

      "summary": "In ancient times, kings set their seals only on that which was valuable – the king’s treasure. When King Jesus fills you with his Holy Spirit, it is proof that you are his treasure. We are redeemed not with corruptible things like silver and gold, but with the blood of God himself (Acts 20:28). Therefore, given the priceless cost of our souls, God seals his purchased possession with his own Holy Spirit. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is proof that God has chosen you and that you are royal property",

The thigh represents one’s seed and, by extension, one’s strength and future. Today, we are the Eleazers of Jesus – we must put our hands under his thigh and promise to bring children that are born again of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. We must bring royal seed that are worthy of the title that is on the thigh of the Lord Jesus Christ. May our blood test read, “Child of the king of kings and Lord of Lords",

Right here we see the necessity of believing in one God alone, and not a Trinity. God supernaturally revealed to Isaiah the fatherhood of Jesus Christ 700 years prior to the word being made flesh in Israel: Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.",

      "summary": "From the beginning of time, there has been a battle for the attention of youth. God wants to open their eyes to spiritual matters, but the enemy is equally determined to overwhelm their eyes with earthly, material things. When the army of Syria came to capture Elisha in the city of Dothan, the young servant of Elisha was overwhelmed with what his eyes saw. \"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about\" (2 Kings 6:14). Thank God for the man of God! As long as there is an Elisha to pray for the eyes of the young to be spiritually opened, there is hope.",

This was his own, unique experience with the Lord, as we all have our unique experiences with the Lord Jesus. He wanted the world to know about his experience with the Lord. “And there followed him a certain young man” demonstrates this young man’s deep love for Jesus.",
